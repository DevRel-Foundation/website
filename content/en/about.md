The Developer Relations Foundation is an open community of practitioners who aim to elevate the professional practice of developer relations.

This initiative stems from a shared passion for DevRel and the recognition that the profession faces persistent challenges, such as a lack of clarity and difficulty in measuring impact. Despite significant growth in resources and organizations addressing these issues, these resources are fragmented. Our goal is to **create an inclusive, community-driven entity that formally defines DevRel practices, addresses common challenges with best-in-practice resources, and attracts both individuals and organizationsâ€™ decision-makers**.

##  Why a Foundation?

The major benefit of a foundation is that it promotes participatory governance, preventing any single company from monopolizing a collaborative project. Specifically, a foundation ensures:

- Community-driven Governance: Projects are managed by the community for the community, with contributions reviewed and accepted based on merit.

- Open Source: Contributors can use the project's resources without fearing sudden changes in licensing or direction.

- Impartiality: contributions to the content and direction are accepted based on their community value, regardless of their impact on any particular vendor.

A foundation aims to be a trusted, credible, and expert resource, similar to professional bodies in other fields, providing training, certification, continuing education, and advocacy.
