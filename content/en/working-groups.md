At the Developer Relations Foundation, our **Working Groups** are where community members come together to co-create the future of DevRel. These groups are open, collaborative spaces where **everyone carries the water and helps out** â€” every participantâ€™s contribution drives progress.

### How to Join

Participation is open to anyone interested. You can join a Working Group by subscribing to the specific mailing list on [dev-rel.org subgroups](https://lists.dev-rel.org/g/community/subgroups) and participating in their regular calls, GitHub issues and pull requests or discord discussions
