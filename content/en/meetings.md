### Our Community Calls - TODO Touchpoints

Touchpoint meetings serve as a vendor-neutral space to discuss day-to-day challenges and develop best practices for people managing open source operations and strategy (AKA Open Source Program Offices) to integrate into the organization's overall infrastructure. We welcome volunteers from the TODO community and other projectsto deliver a brief presentation, followed by a Q&A session. Example of volunteers are: 

- Representatives from open source projects and initiatives: including independent maintainers, core contributors and project managers
- Representatives from Foundations: including General managers, CTOs, and community managers from small to large ecosystems like the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Open Source Security Foundation, OpenChain, InnerSource Commons, LF Energy, CHAOSS, LF AI & Data Foundation, and more
- Organization's stakeholders: including C-level managers like CTOs
- Members of an OSPO: including open source ambassadors, developer relations professionals, project managers or directors

This collective effort help people to articulate the value of open source management through OSPO and gather insights to better integrate open source into the organization's infrastructure, worker's culture and operations. We host two kinds of Touchpoints every month, happening on different days and at varying cadences and times, with content being cross-shared between both sessions. Conversations are governed under Chatham House Rules:

- TODO Europe Chapter General Member and OSPOlogy Touchpoints (Thursdays)
- TODO General Member Touchpoints (Fridays)

## Other Calendars of Interest

TODO is one of the pillars of the *open source management and operations best practices* ecosystem at the Linux Foundation. We work with sister projects like SPDX (Software Bill Of Material automation tooling and best practices), OpenSSF (Security best practices, training and tools), OpenChain (Process Management Standards), FINOS (best practices for financial services) and CHAOSS (Project / Community health and sustainability metrics). For more info, visit the [LF Management & Best Practices Portal](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/management), where communities of *Best Practice* converge. 

Bellow, people can find the OpenSSF, OpenChain, and CHAOSS Calendars
