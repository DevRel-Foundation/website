We are thrilled to announce that the China Academy for Information and Communications Technology (CAICT)
[has joined TODO as a new General Member and OSPO Adopter](https://landscape.todogroup.org/).

CAICT is a government-backed (Ministry of Industry and Information Technology) ICT research institute in China. They are committed 
to play an active role in TODO Group activities, and share best practices for open source strategic adoption within Chinese organizations.

CAICT collaboration with TODO aims to focus on three key pillars:

* Practice: Promote communication between open source projects and facilitate the application of these projects within organizations.
* Research: Investigate the application and impact of OSPOs in China by collaborating with the global community. This involves gaining insights
into the value of OSPOs, co-referencing and co-creating case studies, and helping with OSPO research.
* Community Engagement: Participate in the OSPO book project and working group discussions in TODO.
  
TODO looks forward to CAICT's contributions and the rich discussions they will bring to the OSPO community.
Their involvement means a strengthening of TODO mission's international ties and a shared commitment to the advancement 
of open source best practices and engagement with organizations.
