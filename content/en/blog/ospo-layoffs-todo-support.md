If you're one of the people affected by layoffs, there are a couple of resources you should know about. 
The TODO community has specific channels and ways to keep people informed of the most recent job offerings 
related to OSPOs and Open Source in organizations:

* **The OSPONews newsletter has an OSPO Jobs section** where active open source or OSPO related job positions are shared on a monthly basis. 
You can also [look at past issues of the newsletter](https://ospo-news.ghost.io/). If your organization is hiring, you can contribute new positions to the OSPOlogy repo. 
The community prepares each of the newsletter issues' content via [this repo](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/tree/main/newsletter#how-to-contribute-to-osponews).

* **#topic-jobs TODO Slack channel:** In this space, the community shares open OSPO positions. TODO also has a repo with sample OSPO job descriptions that the community can 
contribute to with new descriptions. You can find the repo at https://github.com/todogroup/job-descriptions. [Join TODO slack here](https://join.slack.com/t/thetodogroup/shared_invite/zt-169ok18cz-Pi6tpVHTeW9254d1FpkLew).


Moreover, If you're an employer looking to hire for an OSPO position, don't hesitate to contribute to the OSPO Jobs section of the OSPONews 
newsletter or to the job descriptions repo in the TODO Slack.your involvement can help make a difference for someone who's looking for their next role.

We hope this post is helpful in providing support and resources for those affected by OSPO layoffs. Please feel free to share it with anyone who might benefit, 
and don't hesitate to reach out to the TODO community if you need any additional help or support.
