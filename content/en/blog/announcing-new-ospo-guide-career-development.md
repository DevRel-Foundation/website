When it comes to talent management, OSPO professionals appear highly specialized, or their job role seems difficult to categorize into traditional definitions. In fact, one of the many challenges OSPO initiatives are facing is finding the right ways to proactively help staff members plan their career advancement strategy.

Today, the TODO Group launches a [new OSPO guide](https://todogroup.org/guides/career-development/) to help open-source programs improve their career development. The guide covers:

* How to build a sustainable and rewarding career path for OSPO employees

* How to map staff’s diverse job skills and responsibilities in traditional business terms;

* Ways to help build professionals personal brand;

* Understand how an OSPO specific job ladder can support the career development of and retention of key staff, with tips on how to get started creating one;

* Ways to support the growth and development of their staff members’ personal brands as part of their OSPO public-facing work responsibilities.


TODO OSPO guides transfer the knowledge from a wide range of OSPO initiatives across organizations. Take a look at [*Career Development for OSPOs*](https://todogroup.org/guides/career-development/)  and learn from well-known senior OSPO leaders working at Red Hat, Google, or Comcast.
