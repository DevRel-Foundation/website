Conversations within the TODO Community are increasingly centered around securing the supply chain, the adoption of new regulations, nurturing open source culture, and the integration 
of artificial intelligence software tools. These topics have emerged as key points in the operational and strategic decisions within organizations. The TODO Group aims for OSPOs to 
remain at the forefront of these conversations, advocating for and sharing best practices that put open source integration as a priority in the organization’s goals and IT strategy.

Below is the set of goals that TODO Group and TODO Steering Committee members agreed to focus on during 2024. These goals are divided into three pillars: Cross-community Collaboration; 
Adoption and Sustainability; Community Engagement.

## Cross-community Collaboration

While TODO Group will be committed to continue collaboration with a variety of projects and foundations worldwide (e.g LF APAC OSPO SIG, LF Europe, CHAOSS, CNCF, etc), this year we are placing a special emphasis 
on strengthening our collaboration with specific open source foundations and projects, alongside a focused exploration of the AI topic by partnering with existing initiatives driving conversations important 
to the day-to-day operations of OSPOS and strategy:

### Focus Projects in 2024

- Share tools and best practices related to OpenSSF that an Open Source Program Office can leverage. For instance, the adoption of OpenSSF scorecards to improve security practices across a company's development processes.
- Increase participation and contributions to OpenSSF and Special Interest Groups by promoting their resources and tools across various TODO Group platforms and calls.
- Facilitate the exchange of tools, best practices, and insights between the InnerSource Commons community and TODO.
- Ensure we keep highlighting InnerSource Commons initiatives during OSPOlogyLive mini-summits.
- Initiate a formal collaboration with the OSS Review Toolkit project team. Create mechanisms for feedback between OSPOs and the project's maintainers to ensure the tool evolves in response to the changing needs of the community.

### Focus Area in 2024

Explore potential collaborations with existing AI SIG closer to OSPO core needs (e.g open chain AI Compliance SIG, Open Source Initiative AI definition WG, etc). Plan and host a webinar on 
AI compliance best practices, inviting speakers from related communities and allowing time for open discussions.

## Adoption and Project Sustainability

TODO Group Steering Committee aims to find ways to integrate OSPO day-to-day operations into broader organizational strategies and execution plans, enhancing their recognition as a key component of business success.

### Establish Office Hours dedicated to Strategic Value Initiative

Update the way Touchpoint calls operate. Work on an improved framework to make touchpoint calls to become a space where:

- [Keep Doing] Share pain points and success stories from OSPO professionals
- [New] Invite C-level executives and independent practitioners to discuss strategic alignment and pain points, enriching the conversation with diverse perspectives. Introduce an approach of preparing a brief 5-minute presentation in advance of discussions to provide a structured starting point for dialogue.
- [New] Create more concrete outcomes, such as insights gathered to contribute to the OSPO Book, present findings at OSPOCons, and possibly develop a whitepaper, documenting best practices and tactics for OSPO integration into business strategies.
- [Keep Doing] Maintain Chatham House Rules to ensure privacy and openness in conversations.

The TODO Group Steering Committee aims to help in the creation of pathways for students and professionals to validate their open source developer skills within an enterprise setup.

### Develop a certification exam for an Open Source Certified Developer in Enterprise Context

- Build content for an exam designed for developers working in enterprises and students aspiring to work in enterprise environments with a focus on open source software (OSS) usage and contribution.
- Work closely with LF Training to develop the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the certification course. Get Steering Committee member's approval and review of exam questions.
- Identify developers within participating organizations to take a beta version of the exam

## Community Engagement

To foster a more dynamic and engaged community dialogue, TODO Group aims to encourage continued discussion over multiple Touchpoint sessions, focusing on recurrent and emerging topics of high interest. 
Encourage continued dialogue over multiple Touchpoint sessions

- Re-take recurrent conversations interest in topics like the CRA, the EU AI Act, and recent updates on Open Source in AI definition (driven by the Open Source Initiative)
- Proactively communicate Agenda recurrent topics ahead of scheduled meetings
- Implement a feedback system after calls (e.g slack survey) to gauge participant interest, satisfaction, and suggestions for future topics


# Next Steps for The Community

The TODO Group aims the strategic goal document to guide and align the TODO community —including its general members, Ambassadors, Associate projects, and maintainers— 
future contributions within TODO initiatives and new proposals towards achieving the proposed vision for 2024. 

These goals are published in the TODO [goavernance repo](https://github.com/todogroup/governance/blob/main/goals.md) 
for the community to use.
