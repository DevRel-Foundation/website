TODO Group is proud to [announce a new OSPO Mind Map version](https://ospomindmap.todogroup.org/) release. The mind map shows a Open Source Program Office&#39;s (OSPO) responsibilities, roles, behavior, and team size within an organization. This post highlights the major improvements done by the community in this new version of the OSPO Mind Map.

## Updates on `Responsibilities` section

OSPO Mind Map `Responsibilities` section has new OSPO-specific topics and different sub-sections defined, including:

* üìò Develop and Execute Open Source Strategy

* üß≠ Eliminate Friction from Using and Contributing to Open Source

* üñ•Ô∏è Manage Open Source IT Infrastructure

* üìö Give Advice on Open Source

* ü´∂ Grow and Retain Open Source Talent Inside the Organization

* ü§ù Implement InnerSource Practices

* ‚è±Ô∏è Track Performance Metrics

* ü§ù Collaborate with Open Source Organizations

* üìà Prioritize and Drive Open Source Upstream Development

* üìù Establish and Improve Open Source Policies and Processes

* üîç Oversee Open Source Compliance

* üìí Support Corporate Development Activities

Initial pull request with these changes can be found [here](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/pull/111).

**Welcoming Contributors üëã**

The TODO Community welcomes more contributors to the OSPO mind Map to bring together the various communities involved in OSPO-specific topics. This will help to improve open source professionals&#39; guidance across the OSPO ecosystem (e.g topics like &quot;InnerSource&quot;, &quot;Open Source metrics&quot;, &quot;Open Source Compliance&quot; and more).

## Updates on display

Initially, the OSPO Mind Map displayed all sections by default, showing a huge mind map image. Now, when people access [https://ospomindmap.todogroup.org/](https://ospomindmap.todogroup.org/) the display view will only show the first 2 levels, so people can expand specific sections, avoiding unnecessary information and focusing on what matters to them at that time.
