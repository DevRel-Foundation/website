The 7th annual [Open Source Management & OSPO survey](https://www.research.net/r/5GNDNPL) is now accepting responses

This survey is part of a research project to better understand the state and evolution of open source management within organizations and OSPO trends operating across sectors and regions. 
The core audience includes Open Source Program Office (OSPO) managers, C-level executives, CTOs, and other roles within organizations involved in the organization's open source engagement.

We are thankful for the support of Cisco, NGINX, InnerSource Commons Foundation, Open Source Initiative (OSI), and CHAOSS as advisors to and distributors of this survey. The survey closes the first week of August and by completing the survey, you can get a 
30% discount on any of the The Linux Foundation Training and Certification exams
