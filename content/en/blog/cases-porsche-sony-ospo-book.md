The establishment of Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) represents a pivotal transformation in how organizations manage technology stack across the supply chain. 
Open Source leaders from Porsche and Sony have significantly contributed to the [OSPO Book Project](https://ospobook.todogroup.org) by [sharing their OSPO Best Practices](https://ospobook.todogroup.org/use-cases/). 
We aim their stories to help elevate open source adn technical matters to align with business objectives and challenges, by showcasing their unique approaches to integrating open source operations within

## Porsche: Anchoring Open Source in Porsche's Software Strategy

The establishment of an OSPO within Porsche underscores the company's commitment to leveraging open source as a cornerstone of its software strategy. 
This strategic move is not just about adopting open source software but embedding it deeply into the company's fabric.

The Porsche OSPO operates with a clear structure, headed by a lead and organized into various streams. These include a contribution and InnerSource team, an in-house development team, a supplier 
software development team, a vulnerability lifecycle team, and an architecture and development team. This structure is designed to foster innovation and efficiency across the Porsche software ecosystem. 
Additionally, FOSS coordinators/ambassadors play a crucial role, acting as liaisons across different business units to ensure the seamless integration of open-source practices.
