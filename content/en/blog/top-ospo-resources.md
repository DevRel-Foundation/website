At TODO we are taking a short break from our [monthly community calls](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology#-community) during August. The good news is that this might be a great chance to
start learning something new from a community! These are some of the most popular resources powered by TODO, helpful sources of information to read 
through and maybe be inspired by open source leaders involved in OSPOs.


## 1️⃣ OSPOlogy, the study of OSPOs

Recorded videos that share [real OSPO Stories](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/tree/main/meetings#event-page-and-past-sessions) and topics 
that matter. Take a look at [OSPOlogy Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi-ELHAwzoYZvAs4FH-ShaA) and learn how organizations like 
Spotify, Google, RIT, Alliander, Aiven, Bloomberg, Sony, UC Santa Cruz, and more use their OSPOs.

## 2️⃣ OSPO Mind Map

The [OSPO Mind Map](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/tree/main/ospo-mindmap#welcome-to-the-ospo-mind-map-) schemes the main Open Source program 
Office&#39;s responsibilities, roles, behavior, and team size within the Ecosystem and is also a great tool to explain what your OSPO does or can do 
within your organization.

An interactive OSPO Mind Map version can be found at:[https://ospomindmap.todogroup.org/](https://ospomindmap.todogroup.org/)
