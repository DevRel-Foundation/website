The TODO Group, together with Linux Foundation Research, is conducting a survey as part of a research project on the prevalence and outcomes of open source programs among different organizations across the globe. 
 
Open source program offices (OSPOs) help set open source strategies and improve an organization's software development practices. Since 2018, the TODO Group has conducted surveys to assess the state of open source programs across the industry. 
Today, we are pleased to announce the launch of the 2022 edition featuring additional questions to add value to the community. The survey will generate insights into the following areas, including:
