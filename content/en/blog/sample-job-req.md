I ran into several folks this past week at OSCON who expressed a keen interest in creating a dedicated role for Open Source at their respective companies. So what was stopping them? One simple thing: every single one of them was struggling to define exactly what that role means. Instinctively we all have a feeling of what an employee dedicated to Open Source might do, but when it comes time to write it down or try to convince payroll, it can be challenging. Below I have included a starting point for a job description of what a dedicated Open Source manager might do. If you are in this boat, I'd highly recommend that you also check out the slides from our [talk at OSCON](http://todogroup.org/blog/oscon-talk/) this year. In addition, the many blog posts we've [published](http://todogroup.org/blog) about why our respective companies run Open Source.

Also, on top of reusing what is below, we are collecting [open source office job descriptions](https://github.com/todogroup/job-descriptions) on GitHub from the industry that you can learn from.
