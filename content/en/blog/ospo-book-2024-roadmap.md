With the start of the new year, the TODO community would like to provide a quick recap of the latest updates on the collaborative effort: the OSPO Book project. 
This blog post aims to share the roadmap, milestones, and essential information for the contributor's call meeting series in 2024

## What has been done?

During the past last contributor's call in 2023, a few action items were defined to enable the content creators and reviewers to continue working on the book project. Here is a summary of the completed tasks:

* Created, reviewed, and merged a few PRs in the past weeks to align the content, provide a better sense of a unified narrative, and connect the sections through the various [chapters](https://ospobook.todogroup.org/toc/) created so far.
* Included the [acknowledgment section](https://ospobook.todogroup.org/07-chapter/) from the working repo on the website.
* Changed the [footer](https://ospobook.todogroup.org/) text and default logo.

## What‚Äôs next? - 2024 Roadmap

The different milestones can be divided into three core groups: the team involved in content creation; the team involved in project infrastructure and website development; and the review team involved in reviewing existing content and references.

### January - March

* DocTeam: Work with the community and contributors on the next chapter: *Deep Dive into Day-to-Day Operations*. Spend a few minutes during OSPOlogy Europe Sync and OSPO Book Contirbutor's regular calls to brainstorm and define issues faced daily across different topics happening to people working in OSPO-like entities. Take the information from the public meeting notes, anonymize it, and create a set of ‚Äúproblem-solving‚Äù lists to be part of the chapter.

* InfraTeam: Migrate the ospobook.todogroup.org domain to the ospobook.org domain.

* ReviewTeam: Review and update resource links.

### March - May

* DocTeam: Align with the CHAOSS OSPO Working Group to have their members contribute and submit the content for the last topic: Measuring the Success and Impact of Your OSPO ( featured by CHAOSS OSPO Metrics WG).

* ReviewtTeam: Review and update resource links.

### May - September

* DocTeam & ReviewtTeam: Finalize OSPO use cases and quotes across the chapters and set up a call for final review. Set up the release day of the final full version of the book and work on the design and communication plan to have a printed version for OSSummit Europe.


## How can I get involved in this initiative?

The OSPO Book project is an excellent way to acknowledge, reference, and unify efforts that have been made across different open source communities and communities supporting OSPOs across sectors. 
If you are engaged in other communities or know someone who represents an organization that has been working around OSPO resources, please don't hesitate to forward this email to them, share their 
resources in the resource section (by submitting a PR or attending to our calls) and take part in the content creation across the different chapters.

Interested people can join our working group calls anytime. The meeting series is available in TODO community calendar, and an invite was sent to the members of [OSPO Book mailing list](https://lists.todogroup.org/g/WG-ospo-book-project) last month. Just in case, here are the meeting details:
