Last year, the TODO Group published an [initial set of guides](http://todogroup.org/blog/open-source-guides/) focused on the art of open source program management. This year, we plan to continue to update and publish new guides to help our peers in industry to scale out their open source programs and learn from our lesson. Today we are happy to publish a guide on what happens when you are faced with [setting an open source strategy](https://todogroup.org/guides/strategy) for your organization.
