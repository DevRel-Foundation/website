Over the past six months, the Steering Committee members have been
diligently assisting the TODO project in its stewardship and strategic
goals. This summary aims to provide a concise overview of all the topic
discussions and areas of work that the Steering Committee and the
program manager have been focusing on during this period. For public
disclosure, we include a summary of the monthly meeting notes taken.

## Steering Committee Achievements

### Update TODO charters and build Ambassador Program

After months of hard work and discussions, the Steering Committee has
developed a new version of the TODO charters. The decision to make these
changes stems from the remarkable growth of our community across diverse
regions and sectors. Additionally, new structures have been added to
foster better collaboration with open source stakeholders and provide
opportunities for both, individuals and organization's representatives,
to become TODO supporters

Define processes to help the formation and growth of Working Groups

We now have a simplified process for the community to propose and launch
new working groups. Proposals can be submitted through [OSPOlogy
GHDiscussions](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions),
and the issue should clearly document the benefits for the community and
explain how this working group would assist OSPO professionals. The
proposal is later (1) shared with the community to gauge interest and
(2) reviewed by the Steering Committee which approves or declines the
proposal.

### Cultivate relationships with other communities across regions and sectors

There are a variety of active programs that encourage collaboration with other open source communities, projects, and foundations that the SC has reviewed. For instance:

-   [OSPO Local Meetups is a
 framework](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/local-meetups/framework.md)
for in-person local meetups to nurture local communities. It aims
to provide a forum for like-minded professionals to share
knowledge and experience on OSPOs and Open Source Management
within specific regions. One example is The [Japanese OSPO Local Community supported by OpenChain Project and TODO Group](https://community.linuxfoundation.org/ospo-local-meetup-japan-japanese-speaking/).
These regular meetups are led by local TODO ambassadors and are fully in native-speaking language.

-   OSPOlogyLive Europe is a collaborative effort from representatives
of various organizations (CHAOSS, InnerSource Commons, SPDX,
OpenChain, and more) with the aim to facilitate presentations and
roundtable sessions to help organizations effectively implement
Open Source Program Offices based on specific region needs and to
connect open source professionals from both local and international spheres.

    -   [OSPOlogylive Sweden](https://community.linuxfoundation.org/events/details/lfhq-todo-group-europe-presents-ospologylive-workshop-sweden/)

    -   [OSPOlogyLive  Netherlands](https://community.linuxfoundation.org/events/details/lfhq-ospology-european-chapter-presents-ospologylive-share-learn-netherlands/)

    -   (Comming Soon) [OSPOlogyLive Germany](https://community.linuxfoundation.org/events/details/lfhq-ospology-european-chapter-presents-ospologylive-germany/)

### Define processes to review working group efforts and archive inactive initiatives

The SC members voted and agreed that working groups and real-time chat
channels can be removed after being inactive over a period of 3 months
and giving prior notice to the working group mailing list of channels.

This policy is intended to be added to the upcoming TODO Project
Playbook document in the governance repo. People can follow up on the
progress (and file their ideas) in the dedicated
[issue](https://github.com/todogroup/governance/issues/283).
