We are thrilled to announce some exciting updates and new resources for OSPOlogyLive 2023. As you may know, OSPOlogyLive is a series of 
interactive micro-conferences in Europe that connect open source program office (OSPO) professionals and open source peers involved in several open source 
projects and communities from both local and international spheres. These micro-conferences are designed as interactive lectures and breakout rooms t
hat aim to foster discussions and connections among attendees.

We have been having conversations with potential hosts and organizers and have made some improvements to the OSPOlogy working repository. 
We hope that these materials will help everyone involved in OSPOlogyLive understand the mission, scope, and requirements for this year.

In addition, we have launched an official [OSPOlogyLive organizers contact email](mailto:ospologylive-organizers@lists.todogroup.org) to centralize our communication efforts and improve transparency 
within the group. This will ensure that everyone is on the same page and help us work together more effectively.

Let's now take a quick look at the new and improved documents added to the repository:

* [IMPROVED] OSPOlogyLive [framework](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/ospology-live/framework.md): We've documented key actors, selection criteria, and the approval process. We've also added a new FAQ 
section that addresses some common questions like how many OSPOlogyLive micro-conferences happen each year, whether multiple micro-conferences can be hosted in the same country, and what the difference is between OSPOlogyLive and OSPO Local Meetups.
* [NEW] [Strategic Goals 2023](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/ospology-live/strategic-goals/2023.md#ospology-live-mission--strategic-goals): Our two (2) strategic goals for this year are focused on encouraging diversity across organization sectors, sizes, 
and regions, and showcasing emerging trends from open source communities and projects. These goals are aimed at providing attendees with diverse and exciting experiences while promoting innovation and inclusivity.
* [NEW] [Organizing Team](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/ospology-live/organizing-team.md): We've created a new document that lists the organizations that are building OSPOlogyLive and the representatives from 
these entities that form the OSPOlogyLive organizing team. This team will be responsible for ensuring the success of the micro-conferences and working with hosts and organizers to make sure everything runs smoothly.

## FAQ

We're excited to announce that we've added a new FAQ section to the OSPOlogyLive framework! This section aims to address some of the common questions that 
have been asked over the past few months. You can find the FAQ section [here](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/ospology-live/framework.md#faq).

**1️⃣ How many OSPOlogyLive micro-conferences happens every year?**

We hold a maximum number of three (3) OSPOlogyLive micro-conferences per year in various European countries, each focusing on specific OSPO responsibilities.

**2️⃣ Can I host multiple OSPOlogyLive micro-conferences in the same country?**

We value location diversity and aim to provide opportunities for different regions to host OSPOlogyLive micro-conferences that cater to their specific needs. As a result, we do not plan to organize multiple OSPOlogyLive events in the same region during the same year.

However, one of the goals of OSPOlogyLive is to encourage the growth of local OSPO communities (and encourage native-language), led by local ambassadors. We believe that local OSPO meetups, powered by the TODO Group, can provide valuable opportunities for networking, learning, and collaboration among open source enthusiasts in a specific area.

If you're interested in becoming a local OSPO ambassador or organizing an OSPO meet-up, please check out OSPO Local Meetups Framework and local host guidelines for more information on how you can get involved.b Current OSPO Local Meetups includes OSPO Local Chapter Finland, Netherlands and Japan.

**3️⃣ What is the differentce between OSPOlogy Live and OSPO Local Meetups?**

Scope of OSPOlogyLive:

* Led by highly committed OSPOlogyLive organizers' representatives
* Collaboration among open source enthusiasts at local and global levels
* Provide opportunities for local OSPO communities to start

Scope of OSPO Local Meetups:

* Fully-led by local ambassadors
* Less structured to promote native language
* Collaboration among open source enthusiasts in a specific area (local)
* Lower commitment from OSPOlogyLive organizers' representatives
* Provide opportunities for local OSPO communities to grow and develop

**4️⃣ How can I be part of the organizing team if my organization is not hosting?**

Here's what you need to do:

* Be a representative from an open source community, project, or foundation involved in the OSPO movement (e.g., adoption, day-to-day operations, etc).
* Submit an [OSPO Associates request](https://github.com/todogroup/ospolandscape/issues/new/choose) to use the open source project's logo brand in future OSPOlogyLive micro-conferences. You can find more information about the OSPO Associates program at todogroup.org/associates.
* Wait for the currecnt OSPOlogyLive organizers to review and approve your request. Approval will happen if 2/3 of current OSPOlogy Live organizers approves.

## Conclusion

We believe that these updates and resources will be valuable to all potential hosts and organizers, and we're excited to see what kind of amazing 
micro-conferences will come out of OSPOlogyLive 2023. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at ospologylive-organizers@lists.todogroup.org.
