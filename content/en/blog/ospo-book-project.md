The [OSPO book project](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/ospo-book/README.md) is one of the most recent initiatives hosted under the OSPOlogy repo. 
Whether you contribute to new chapters, review existing PRs, include new book terms in the glossary.md, or make translations into your native language, there are many 
ways to become an active member of this community.

The OSPO Book Project has improved its documentation to help new contributors get started in the project. Together, we can build a more inclusive and complete 
book that serves as a baseline for Open Source Program Offices in organizations. This includes sharing collective knowledge from open source professionals and providing 
an ordered list of links to existing literature across different open source projects.

Here are the updated documentation added this week:

* [GOVERNANCE.md](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/ospo-book/GOVERNANCE.md) outlines the different contributor roles within the project and the responsibilities that come with them.
* [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/ospo-book/CONTRIBUTING.md) includes a newcomer section to facilitate new contributions.
* [Table Of Contents (TOC.md)](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/ospo-book/chapters/toc.md) provides more information on the different topics expected to be covered in each chapter.

## üß© About the project

In a nutshell, the OSPO Book Project aims to address the following community needs:

* Create an easy-to-understand guide on everything organizations need to know on open source program offices
* Build an OSPO body of knowledge (combine public and existing OSPO resources and give them an order)
* Develop a collective voice to work on missing links required to make a comprehensive OSPO book
* Proactively search for representatives from open source bodies helping organizations to streamline open source as collaborators: This includes open source leaders working 
in OSPOs but also individuals participating in open source communities and projects specialized and helping the open source movement within organizations across different sectors
